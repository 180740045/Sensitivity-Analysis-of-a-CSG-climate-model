## Sensitivity Analysis of a Chinese Solar Greenhouse (CSG) Climate Model

### Abstract

The Chinese Solar Greenhouse (CSG) is a type of protected cultivation applied in the northern
rural areas of China. It is considered a passive solar greenhouse since it is only heated by the
sun; moreover, the only controllable variables are the opening of the vents and the deployment
of the thermal blanket. For getting an accurate forecast of the inside climate conditions and to
be able to implement a controller, it is required to perform a sensitivity analysis as part of the
model development process. A sensitivity analysis allows us to identify the highly sensible
variables and the most important parameters of the model. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis
assesses the set of parameters that have the greatest influence on the outputs variability of the
model.

The objective of this thesis project is to perform the sensitivity analysis of the model developed
by Zhou et al. (2020) for estimating the climate inside a CSG, to identify the parameters (greenhouse
design parameters) that have the greatest influence on the model output (air temperature).
Three different methods were applied and compared. A one-at-a-time (OAT) sensitivity
analysis was used to determine the local sensitivities and select a subset of parameters for
global analysis. Additionally, a multiple linear regression and a variance-based method were
applied for global sensitivity analysis.

The study resulted in a ranking on the relevance of the parameters from the CSG climate
model. A selection of parameters suited for calibration was also presented. By comparing
the outcomes of the different methodologies it was compared the suitability of global sensitivity
analysis and local sensitivity analysis for complex models such as the CSG climate model.
